• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?
gitignore - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore. 
These are the files which are in local repository but we don't want them in remote repository. 
For java project the .gitignore file should contain *.class file.

• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
This is basicall a situation where 2 team members might have checked out at the
same time from master and then both worked locally on testbranch and testbranch2.
One of you got done (testbranch) and merged into master. So this one had the easy
merge into the master, since it was basically a fast forward.

• Why should you have different branches?
Having different branches allow different people to work independently. 
they are meant to be used: making changes in the project safely off to one side, 
and merging them back into the original project once they have proved to be correct. Or at least not disastrous.

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
It depends on the project and team members.
